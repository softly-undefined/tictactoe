# Vanishing TicTacToe

Vanishing Tic Tac Toe presents an intriguing challenge in the domain of game-playing AI due to its deceptively simple rules and compact state space, which nonetheless give rise to rich strategic complexity. In this project, we investigate the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to this niche game, aiming to develop an agent that achieves superhuman performance. Despite the limited number of possible game states, the dynamic nature of Vanishing Tic Tac Toe demands nuanced decision-making and long-term planning, making it a compelling testbed for evaluating the effectiveness of DRL methods in low-dimensional yet nontrivial environments. Our approach involves training agents using state-of-the-art deep learning architectures and reinforcement learning algorithms, with a focus on sample efficiency and convergence behavior. Ideally, the resulting agent will demonstrate strategic mastery surpassing that of human players, offering insights into how deep learning can uncover optimal policies in constrained yet complex game environments.
